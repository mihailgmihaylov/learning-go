# learning-go
My first steps in golang. Tests, fails and some spaghetti... 

## What/where/why is this repo?

As a new project initiative in my company (Receipt Bank) we have begun a new golang course.
In it we are all going to learn to do stuff with go and thus be a little less strange to the
source code of the tools we use as DevOps engineers.

I will store my progress, ideas and stuff I do throughout the course so I may laugh at it
in the end :)

## To the reader

I don't know why and how you stumbled upon this repo but feel free to laugh at the code,
make suggestions, or give ideas of some interesting programs I can try and do :)
